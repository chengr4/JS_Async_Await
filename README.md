# JS_Async_Await
Sychronous is when something is going on, but you don't want to wait
until that thing is done to continue your program.   
-> you want to continue while it's happening = Asychronously

## Callback vs. Promise
Parameter callback is altered (delete).    
And .then() will be used when calling the function!
